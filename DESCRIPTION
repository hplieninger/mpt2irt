Description: Multinomial processing tree (MPT) models are used to differentiate
    between different cognitive processes in categorical data. Those can be
    lifted to hierarchical MPT models to account for person- and/or item effects
    (Matzke et al., 2015): This is done by reparameterizing each MPT parameter
    by means of an item response (IRT) model. Boeckenholt (2012) developed a
    model to disentengle two reponse styles, namely midpoint (MRS) and extreme
    responding (ERS), and the target trait. This package allows to fit an
    extension of this Boeckenholt Model to acquiescence (ARS). It makes use of
    Bayesian hierarchical models requiring Stan or JAGS.
